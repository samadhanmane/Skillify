# Deployment Fix Instructions

## 1. Fix CORS Issue

To fix the CORS issue between your Vercel frontend and Render backend, update your environment variables on Render:

1. Go to your Render dashboard for the backend service (https://dashboard.render.com/)
2. Navigate to the "Environment" tab
3. Add or update the following environment variables:

```
NODE_ENV=production
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://skillify-credentials.com,https://www.skillify-credentials.com,https://skillify-phi.vercel.app
FRONTEND_URL=https://skillify-phi.vercel.app
```

4. Click "Save Changes"

## 2. Fix 404 Not Found Errors

You're experiencing 404 errors because your frontend is requesting URLs without the `/api` prefix that your backend expects.

### 2.1 Fixed Endpoints:
- `/setup` → `/api/setup` (fixed)
- `/auth/login` → `/api/auth/login` (fixed)

To fix these issues, we've added route handlers that forward requests to the correct endpoints:

```javascript
// For /setup endpoint
app.get('/setup', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ 
    success: true, 
    message: 'MongoDB connected and API is running',
    version: process.env.API_VERSION || '1.0.0',
    environment: process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development'
  });
});

// For all /auth/* endpoints
app.use('/auth', (req, res, next) => {
  req.url = req.originalUrl.replace('/auth', '/api/auth');
  app.handle(req, res);
});
```

To deploy these fixes:

1. Commit and push the changes to server.js to your GitHub repository
2. If Render is set up for automatic deployments, it should deploy automatically
3. If not, manually deploy the latest version from your Render dashboard

## 3. Verify the Deployment

After the deployment is complete:

1. Test the direct endpoints:
   - https://skillify-2irh.onrender.com/setup
   - https://skillify-2irh.onrender.com/auth/login (with a POST request)
2. They should work without 404 errors
3. Then test your frontend at https://skillify-phi.vercel.app

## Alternative Frontend Fix

If you can't update the backend right away, you can also fix this by updating your frontend code to use the correct API URLs:

1. Find where your API URL is defined in your frontend code (likely in `src/lib/axios.ts` or `src/setupBackend.ts`)
2. Make sure all API calls include the `/api` prefix:
   - Change `https://skillify-2irh.onrender.com/setup` to `https://skillify-2irh.onrender.com/api/setup`
   - Change `https://skillify-2irh.onrender.com/auth/login` to `https://skillify-2irh.onrender.com/api/auth/login`
