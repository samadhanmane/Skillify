# Deployment Fix Instructions

## 1. Fix CORS Issue

To fix the CORS issue between your Vercel frontend and Render backend, update your environment variables on Render:

1. Go to your Render dashboard for the backend service (https://dashboard.render.com/)
2. Navigate to the "Environment" tab
3. Add or update the following environment variables:

```
NODE_ENV=production
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://skillify-credentials.com,https://www.skillify-credentials.com,https://skillify-phi.vercel.app
FRONTEND_URL=https://skillify-phi.vercel.app
```

4. Click "Save Changes"

## 2. Fix 404 Not Found Error

You're getting a 404 error because your frontend is requesting `/setup` but your backend has the route defined as `/api/setup`.

To fix this, you need to deploy the updated server.js file that includes the new route handler for `/setup`.

1. Commit and push the changes to server.js to your GitHub repository
2. If Render is set up for automatic deployments, it should deploy automatically
3. If not, manually deploy the latest version from your Render dashboard

## 3. Verify the Deployment

After the deployment is complete:

1. Test the direct endpoint: https://skillify-2irh.onrender.com/setup
2. It should return a JSON response with `success: true`
3. Then test your frontend at https://skillify-phi.vercel.app

## Alternative Frontend Fix

If you can't update the backend right away, you can also fix this by updating your frontend code to use the correct API URL:

1. Find where your API URL is defined in your frontend code
2. Make sure it's using `https://skillify-2irh.onrender.com/api/setup` instead of `https://skillify-2irh.onrender.com/setup`

This is likely in a file like `src/lib/axios.ts` or `src/setupBackend.ts`
